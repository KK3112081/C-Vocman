# C-Vocman
Vocman is a project I created to participate in the early programming test NAR-22 using the C language. Vocman is a game with the main character, a mouse (M), whose goal is to eat all 15 pieces of cheese (C) located inside the arena. However, we must be careful not to make a wrong move and collide with obstacles.
