# C-Vocman
Vocman is a project that I created to participate in initial programming test NAR-22. Vocman is a game with the main character, a mouse (M), whose goal is to eat all 15 pieces of food (.) located inside the arena, but we must be careful not to make a wrong move and get caught by the enemy (C).
